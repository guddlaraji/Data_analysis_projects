# Airlines Flight Data Analysis

This project analyzes airline flight data using Python and MySQL to uncover trends in ticket pricing, flight routes, and airline performance. SQL is used to query and aggregate flight data, while Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib are used for analysis and visualization. The project provides insights into factors like travel class, duration, stops, and days before departure that influence ticket prices.
